The datasets used in this study are designed for collaborative detection of power equipment faults and worker safety protection in hydropower station scenarios, and consist of the following two components: Electrical Equipment Failure Dataset (EEF) This dataset is sourced from the Roboflow platform, available at: https://universe.roboflow.com/ppe-detection-7kco8/station-raaga-ogkgf/dataset/2. It includes 8 typical categories of power equipment fault targets: arc, disconnector, disconnector_open, insulator, spark, switch, switchgear, and transformer. The original dataset contains 5,711 images. To address the potential limitations in model feature learning caused by the small sample size, this study applies the official data augmentation strategies provided by Roboflow. These include horizontal flipping, Â±25% brightness adjustment, and the addition of 0.1% random noise. As a result, the dataset is expanded to a total of 10,145 images. Personal Protective Equipment Dataset (PPE) The dataset is available at: https://universe.roboflow.com/liu-hxoap/yui-2s6gc-180su/dataset/2, and contains a total of 8,571 images. It is primarily used to detect safety equipment worn by workers, including five target categories: gloves, helmet, person, shoe, and vest.
